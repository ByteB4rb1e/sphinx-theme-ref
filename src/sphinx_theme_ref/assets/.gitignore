# generated by Tiara's HTML Theming Reference Implementation
#
# this .gitignore serves the purpose of allowing wrapping projects, that
# generate this project's assets dynamically, not having to worry about
# auxiliary debugging assets polution. The file is supposed to be copied by
# webpack into the output directory, so the globbing patterns shouldn't match
# the current directory. That's why it's called `gitignore` instead of
# `.gitignore` so that it isn't actually being picked up by git. webpack should
# rewrite the basename.
#
# Depending on your level of paranoia towards breaking changes in dependencies
# with no access to working versions, you can either choose to ignore the entire
# directory and generate HTML theme assets just-in-time, or commit them as
# static assets. I'm running registry proxies as pull-through mirrors locally,
# that I back up regularly, to keep my paranoia at bay. That way, I can.just
# gitignore the directory and generate all assets dynamically.
