# Tiara's Sphinx Theme Reference Implementation

> **Heads up**: This is a work-in-progress reference implementation to showcase
  how [Tiara's HTML Theming Reference](https://github.com/ByteB4rb1e/html-theme-ref) 
  can integrate with a from-scratch Sphinx documentation theme. I'll be *working
  backwards*, so expect the project to align with this *README*, not the other
  way around.

This implementation is designed to elevate Sphinx documentation through a
modular, standards-driven approach. Built from the ground up using Tiara's HTML
Theming Reference, this project reflects a commitment to accessibility,
frugality, and adherence to the UNIX philosophy.

**What This Is**  
- A **minimalistic yet extensible** Sphinx theme built with a CSS-first mindset.  
- A **reference implementation** to show how HTML themes can integrate
  seamlessly with Sphinx.
- A **template** for developers aiming to build documentation themes with
  clarity and modularity in mind.

**What This Is NOT**  
- A pre-packaged Sphinx theme ready for production use.
- A general-purpose theming framework—this is specific to the philosophy behind
  Tiara's HTML Theming Reference.

## Why Use This?

For developers seeking a straightforward and modular solution, this reference
implementation provides a clear and adaptable foundation. It’s designed to
empower users to create documentation themes that reflect their specific
requirements without unnecessary complexity.

### Key Principles:

1. **Accessibility First**

Fully compliant with a11y standards to make documentation inclusive

2. **Frugal Engineering**

Lightweight, efficient design for optimal performance.

3. **CSS First**

Declarative styling ensures better maintainability.

4. **UNIX Philosophy**

Each piece does one thing well—and nothing more.

5. **Customizability**

Easily adapt the theme to suit your documentation needs.

## Goals

This project demonstrates how Tiara's HTML Theming Reference integrates with
documentation platforms like Sphinx by:

- **Showcasing Modularity**: Focusing on separation of concerns for clean,
  maintainable code.
- **Exploring Scalability**: Demonstrating how to standardize HTML theming
  across platforms.
- **Promoting Standards**: Adhering to W3C, accessibility guidelines, and UNIX
  principles.

For the philosophy behind this, see [Tiara's HTML Theming Reference README](https://github.com/ByteB4rb1e/html-theme-ref).
